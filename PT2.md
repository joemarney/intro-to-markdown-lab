## Opening the Terminal

1. Use **Command + Space bar**
2. Type **Terminal**

## Know your Roots

The terminal is an application where you can see inside every directory that is on your computer. It can create and delete directories so it is important to know where you are so you don't delete your whole life.

4. Type **cd ~**
5. Type **pwd**

> cd ~ takes you back to your root directory.

> pwd shows you where you currently are.

## Creating a Directory

A directory also known as a folder is where files can be organised and stored within a computers hard drive.

_example would be the name of the directory you want to make_

6. Type **mkdir example**
7. Type **cd example**

> mkdir is creating a directory.

> cd we used before and it can be used with the name of the destination to take you there.

## Creating a File

_example would be the name of the file you want to make_

8. Type **touch example.js**

> touch creates a file in the directory you are in.

### You have successfully created a JS file within a directory.
